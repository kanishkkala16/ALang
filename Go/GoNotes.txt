The go run command
The go run command does in fact compile your code into a binary. However, the
binary is built in a temporary directory. The go run command builds the binary, exe‐
cutes the binary from that temporary directory, and then deletes the binary after your
program finishes. This makes the go run command useful for testing out small pro‐
grams or using Go like a scripting language.

goimports
There’s an enhanced version of go fmt available called goimports that also cleans up
your import statements. It puts them in alphabetical order, removes unused imports,
and attempts to guess any unspecified imports. Its guesses are sometimes inaccurate,
so you should insert imports yourself.
You can download goimports with the command go install golang.org/x/
tools/cmd/goimports@latest. You run it across your project with the command:
goimports -l -w .
The -l flag tells goimports to print the files with incorrect formatting to the console.
The -w flag tells goimports to modify the files in-place. The . specifies the files to be
scanned: everything in the current directory and all of its subdirectories.
